SQL NOTES:

When using UNION, you can use LIMIT only for the whole, not for each part

Use self join to get all combinations

COUNT(*) is the number of rows. COUNT(col_name) is the number of NON-NULL values in col_name

Apostrophe escape > double it up (‘’)

Average is AVG, not AVE

Use DATEDIFF(a_date, b_date) for num of days. b_date - a_date, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND

HAVING must come BEFORE ORDER BY

DISTINCT to de-dupe

LIMIT needs to be followed by an int. No functions like FLOOR to find mid-point

You can use JOIN with BETWEEN in the ON

XOR for exclusive OR (one or the other, but not both)

MOD(a, b) is a % b

POWER(a, b) is a ** b

CHAR_LENGTH(text) is # of chars

LEFT(text , 10)

LOWER(text) to make it lowercase

There's no IF. Use
CASE (indicates if elif else starts)
  WHEN ..... THEN .....
  WHEN ..... THEN .....
  ELSE .....
END

COALESCE(a, b, …)takes the first value that’s not NULL

CONCAT(text1, text2, ...)

MySQL has no FULL OUTER JOIN. Only INNER, LEFT, RIGHT

Trick with CASE-END. When counting, use it with THEN 1 and ELSE 0.

Every derived table must have its own alias
