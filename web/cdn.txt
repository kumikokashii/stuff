CDN (= Content Delivery Network)
summary by CEO of Fastly: https://youtu.be/farO15_0NUQ

what do they do?
- Caching
- Serve user from a closer location

why?
1. Performance
- Bounce rate goes up as latency adds up

2. Security
- DDOS (= distributed denial-of-service) attacks

3. Availability
- Even if your server goes down, it can serve what it has

* Even with no cacheable content, the shorter distance b/w the requester and CDN, plus the already established connection b/w CDN and your server help deliver the response more fastly!
