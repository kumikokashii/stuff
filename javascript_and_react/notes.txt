- setting up
  - Store is the global state. when creating a Store, give all Reducers and Middleware (thunk).
  - Reducer is a function that, given a state and a payload, returns the updated state PER Action.
  - Action is a function that returns its own attributes like name and payload.
  - wrap the app in <Provider store={store}> :) </Provider>
  
- using:
  - To use a state value,
  const { value } = useSelector(state => state.value);
  - To update a state value,
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  onClick={() => dispatch(updateValue())} where updateValue is an action.

- combine action and reducer w/ slice

Testing React with Jest and Enzyme
- basic: https://medium.com/codeclan/testing-react-with-jest-and-enzyme-20505fec4675
- Enzyme simulate events like click: https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/simulate.html
- mock function explained: https://youtu.be/2d-SX8YRyis
- Expect: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect

Testing basics
- each test case starts with clean setup
- need a test when we wanna see if something is rendered first time (a new page, a new text that shows up on a click, etc)

General basics
- logic and view in 1 component is a good design
- when importing libraries, import only minimal needed like: import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep' (rather than: import _ from 'lodash')

Debouncing with React

- Key is in returning the clearTimeout func in useEffect. This is called every time the search input value is updated.
