STATS NOTES:

===========================================
Binomial Distribution
===========================================
* n independent observations

* Each observation is Bernoulli Distribution
  * 'success' (1) or 'failure' (0)
  * Probability of success is p
  * Mean = (p * 1) + ((1 - p) * 0) = p
  * Variance = p(1 - p)

* Written B(n, p)
* Mean = np
* Variance = np(1 - p)

* Sampling distribution
  * First sampling (picking random n from population) gives the value of B_1(n, p)
  * Then the proportion of 'success' is B_1(n, p) / n
  * Continue sampling...
  
  * Then sampling distribution (distribution of the proportion of 'success' from various samples) has:
    * Mean = p
    * Variance = p(1 - p) / n
    * Rule of thumb: If np >= 10 and n(1 - p) >= 10, then normal distribution

===========================================
Central Limit Theorem
===========================================
* Sampling distributin of sample mean (where sample size n is large enough, like 30) 
is a normal distribution with:
  * Mean = population mean
  * Variance = population variance * (1 / n)
* Populatin distribution can be of any shape (not normal distribution)

===========================================
Hypothesis Testing
===========================================
1. Your sample has a value of x with hypothesis A
2. Assume the null hypothesis is true (hypothesis A is not true)
3. Given your sample size n, population mean, and population standard deviation, 
find the probability of x happening: p-value (probability value)
4. Assumption is that the possibility of x happening is larger than the (given) significance level
5. If p-value < significance level, a contradiction. Reject the null hypothesis. Hypothesis A is true.

* The significance level is usually 5% or less
* If sample size is small (like less than 30), use t-score rather than z-socre

===========================================
Confidence Level and Interval (Margin or Error)
===========================================
* Example: 'With 95% confidence level, x is between 5 and 10 (sample size 100)' means that 
when this experiment is repeated with different sets of samples (of the same smaple size 100), 
95% of the times the intervals (that are different every time) will contain true x.

1. Pick n samples from population (ofen, we want to guess population mean)
2. We find that sample mean is p (chance of the 'success' event happening is (p * 100)%)
3. Sampling distribution is a normal distribution with its mean being population mean and
its standarard deviation being population standard deviation * (1 / n) ^ (1 / 2) = sampling_sd
4. There's a 95% chance that p is within 2 sampling_sd of population mean
i.e. there's a 95% chance that population mean is within 2 sampling_sd of p
6. We don't know population standard deviation to calculate sampling_sd
7. Instead estimate with sample standard deviation: 
Standard Error = sample standard deviation * (1 / n) ^ (1 / 2) = se
8. We're 95% confident that the interval (p - 2*se, p + 2*se) captured population mean

* Use t-score (degree of freedom = n - 1) instead of z-score

* Samples need to be randomly picked
* Need n >= 30, or samples are picked from (or resemble) normal distribution (Normal Condition)
* Sample size needs to be less than 10% of population size (Independence Condition)

===========================================
Comparing two samples, difference between the two populations
===========================================
* Population A: pop_mean_A, pop_var_A
* Population B: pop_mean_B, pop_var_B
* Sample A (size n) from population A: sample_mean_A, sample_var_A
* Sample B (size m) from population B: sample_mean_B, sample_var_B

* Sampling distribution of sample_mean_A: sd_mean_A = pop_mean_A, sd_var_A = pop_var_A / n
* Sampling distribution of sample_mean_B: sd_mean_B = pop_mean_B, sd_var_B = pop_var_B / m

* Sampling distribution of sample_mean_A - sample_mean_B:
  mean = sd_mean_A - sd_mean_B = pop_mean_A - pop_mean_B
  var = sd_var_A + sd_var_B = (pop_var_A / n) + (pop_var_B / m)

* AB Testing: Assume the null hypothes (pop_mean_A - pop_mean_B = 0)
* Estimate pop_var_A with sample_var_A, pop_var_B with sample_var_B (use t-score instead of z-score)
